Inspired by the AI logic game "Wumpus World", this game places you in a 5x5 grid filled with surprises:

💰 Collect gold

🌬️ Pay attention to breezes (hinting nearby danger)

🧍‍♂️ Choose your character

🏆 Track your score on a local leaderboard

🎨 Features
5x5 tile-based grid with visited cell tracking

Cute character sprites and pixel art assets

Danger hints with visual cues (breeze icon)

Point system (+10 for gold, -5 for Wumpus/Pit)

Restart game with R, view leaderboard with L

Simple start screen and name entry screen

Local leaderboard stored in leaderboard.txt

🛠️ Technologies Used
Python 3

Pygame

File I/O (for leaderboard)

Basic game loop, sprite handling, and collision logic
💡 Inspiration
This project was built as a creative take on the Wumpus World environment — blending logic, fun visuals, and user interaction. Great for anyone starting out with Pygame or game dev!
